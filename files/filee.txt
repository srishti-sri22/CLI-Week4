Programming languages implement threads in a few different ways, and many operating systems provide an API the programming language can call for creating new threads. The Rust standard library uses a 1:1 model of thread implementation, whereby a program uses one operating system thread per one language thread. There are crates that implement other models of threading that make different trade-offs to the 1:1 model. (Rust’s async system, which we will see in the next chapter, provides another approach to concurrency as well.)
